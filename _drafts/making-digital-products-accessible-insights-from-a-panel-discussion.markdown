# Making Digital Products Accessible 
## Insights from a Panel Discussion

### Introduction
Every Year on Global Accessibility Awareness Day, people come together to raise awareness about the barriers many users still face in the digital world. This May, two of our consultants, Doro and Oded, attended an accessibility panel discussion and workshop with UserVision on Creating Accessible Digital Experiences. The panel brought together experts in the field, including Mark Palmer, the accessibility lead from the Scottish government; Karen Wilcox, the digital product optimization manager at Postcode Lottery; Graham Gunning, vice-chair of Triple Tap Tech; and Harjeet Dhanda, an accessibility consultant from User Vision. The inspiring event fuelled conversations for many weeks afterwards, and we would like to share some of our reflections and key takeaways to share our inspiration and motivation to create an inclusive digital world.

Here you can read and/or listen to our thoughts and takeaways on the panel discussion, so let’s first introduce ourselves. 

Doro: “My name is Doro, and I’m a Graduate Developer at Scott Logic. Before becoming a developer, I studied Psychology and worked in mental health, so I enjoy bringing a people-focused view to coding. 

Oded: “And my name is Oded and I’m a senior developer at Scott Logic. I’ve been a developer for about 20 years and I try to focus on the human element and how technology can improve our lives”

Doro: “That was a great event! What an enlightening panel discussion! Every panellist  brought in so many different perspectives on making digital products and services more accessible!”

Oded:  “Yes, I also found the entire event very inspiring. I thought the panelists’ approach was very down-to-earth, and some of their insights were invaluable. What were your biggest takeaways?”

### The barriers that users face
Doro: “There’s a lot of barriers that disabled people face online. A lot of those barriers could be easily removed if we paid more attention to how we build our websites.“ 

Oded: “Indeed, for people with visual impairment—such as Graham—for example,, websites’ accessibility could be the difference between being able to make use of the website or not. And sometimes it doesn’t require extra effort from the developer’s point-of-view but simply using the (semantically) correct HTML tags in the relevant places.” 

Doro: “I promise to never use a *<div>* as a *<button>* anymore! It’s really not hard to do, it just takes some practice to get into the right habits.” 

Oded: “Absolutely, and optimising websites for screen readers can also make a massive difference.” 

Doro: “Yes, when you navigate through a webpage using the tab key, you can see all the elements that are keyboard focusable, and the ones that aren't. And it’s remarkable how much text and information is still only displayed visually, in images and icons for example. Tools that use Optical Character Recognition OCR (image-to-text) allows reading text that would be missed by a screen reader, but ‘text in image’ is an inaccessible practice to begin with. A lot of this sounds technical, but it’s simply how people with visual impairments navigate the world every day“

Oded: “During the pandemic, many essential services transitioned to be online-first, and if they’re not fully accessible - they’ll exclude disabled people. It was encouraging to hear, however, that progress is being made and the awareness of accessibility issues is increasing.”

Doro: “I can’t imagine what that must have been like at the start of the pandemic, suddenly so many essential services are online, but that doesn't mean they are accessible.”

Oded: “A lot of people might imagine that an online service would make it more accessible and approachable to everyone but in reality if the service isn’t designed properly it will exclude disempowered population, such as elderly people who might be less tech-savvy. We, in the high-tech industry, are used to thinking that everyone is digitally-literate like we are. The reality is actually very far from it.”

Doro: “All the more reason for us to build websites that everyone can use. As developers, we take pride in writing clean code and building user interfaces that look amazing and are easy to use. It's pride in good craftsmanship. I really can't see accessibility as separate from that. Imagine a user tries out your website and says *"that's a beautiful website, but I can’t click that button"*. I know I would rush to fix that right away. Seems pretty obvious that that’s a bug. That’s what disabled users experience everyday, but a lot of developers are oblivious to that.”

Oded: “Remember that story that one of the panellists told, about building an app that helps with seating arrangements, but when a visually impaired accessibility consultant tested the app, he came back and said *‘The app is in line with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and I can book a seat, but where does my dog sit?’* “

Doro: “They had forgotten to allocate the complimentary space on the seating plan for service dogs!” 

Oded: “Yes, so even though they met all the criteria of the WCAG, their app was not actually accessible. The WCAG are a good start, but they do not cover everything and that is where lived experience accessibility consultants can really really raise the bar, especially if they are part of the design process from the very start.”

### Including accessibility from the start
Doro: “That’s one thing every one of the panelists brought up: How important it is to think about accessibility from start to finish of the project. That’s something that a lot of organisations are not used to, so that really requires a mindset shift. Leadership commitment can make a big difference. When leaders prioritise accessibility, it creates a culture where accessibility is valued and ingrained.”

Oded: “Yes, and that is not about 'sprinkling accessibility' at the end or making adjustments; it's about creating an ecosystem that supports accessibility, like bringing up accessibility as part of the MVP, and making sure it’s addressed in the “Definition of Ready” and the “Definition of Done” stages.”

Doro: “I thought that was really insightful, hearing how one way to improve accessibility is to talk about it more at different stages of development. That really drives home the point that accessibility is not just one person or team’s job, but that it’s all of our jobs to improve accessibility. It’s a shared responsibility between all of us, and we can all help take steps in the right direction. It’s okay if things aren’t perfect right away, every accessibility improvement allows another person to browse your website without barriers, so incremental change is good!” 

Oded: “It’s important for all organisations to make changes to be more accessible, not only because there are legal requirements to be met. Especially in the public sector, accessibility is critical. The government needs to make sure that its services are accessible to all citizens, not just some citizens.  This stems from the core principles of democracy and it might sound overrated but I’m sure that people who can’t access a critical service like issuing a driving licence or a passport would think that it’s critical.”

Doro: “It's about providing equal opportunities and ensuring that no one is left behind.” 

Oded: “It was great how Karen talked about always bringing in the human element in discussions about accessibility, and illustrating the needs of sample personas so that it’s really clear that this is about individual people, not a checkbox to tick off the WCAG requirements.”

Doro: “It was interesting hearing about how creating personas can be an easy way to bring in that human element throughout the design process: *“This is John. He is blind. He wants to buy a lottery ticket and then go eat his dinner.”* I see how that can help to include disabled people when we think about our users as people like you and I who just want to go about their business without any faff. It’s about creating a user-friendly experience. I think there’s great value in empathising with different viewpoints and experiences and approaching your design and build process from multiple perspectives.“

### Accessibility benefits everyone
Oded: “And every perspective that you take into account offers the possibility to improve your results. Prioritising accessibility benefits not only disabled people but can also remove barriers for someone with a temporary or situational limitation. This graphic from the Microsoft inclusive design toolkit explains that really well:”

Doro: “Yes, that’s called 'the curb-cut effect', it’s the idea that accessibility features might be appreciated by a much larger user group than originally thought. The dropped curb on sidewalks was originally designed for wheelchair users, but then it turned out that skateboarders, and people with bicycles and prams found them really useful, too. Now, they have become so ubiquitous that most people don’t even think of them as an accessibility feature anymore.” 

Oded: “It’s great when accessibility becomes part of the norm. It does require dedication from companies, of course. It was interesting to hear from one of the panellists that their company actually changed their company logo when they realised the colours were too bright and didn’t have the right contrast. A brand change is not a small feat for an organisation! That’s an impressive level of dedication. I would love to see more companies take accessibilities this seriously. Awareness raising is an essential first step.“

Doro: “We can’t make progress if we don’t understand what we need to work towards and why. Talking about the financial incentives, like [The Purple Pound](https://wearepurple.org.uk/the-purple-pound-infographic/), can nudge people in the right direction. When companies realise that they are turning away millions of potential customers by being inaccessible, they might take steps to address that more quickly. It sometimes feels a bit callous to bring up the business case for accessible design, after all, creating a society where everyone is included should be enough. Still, I understand that every organisation has competing priorities, and a financial incentive can be a great motivator.”

Oded: “Ultimately we want to foster a culture where accessibility is valued and ingrained. Accessibility has many benefits: Supporting disabled people first and foremost, then there’s the curb-cut effect, legal requirements, and there are financial incentives, too. Depending who your audience is and the context in which you advocate for inclusivity, different arguments are going to make more sense to different people, and that’s okay. The important part is that we’re moving in the right direction.”

Doro: “When more people with different responsibilities understand the value of accessibility, it becomes easier to incorporate accessibility throughout the entire project lifecycle and to see accessibility as a shared responsibility across the organisation. Over time, accessibility moves from being the exception to being the norm.”

Oded: “Talking about accessibility is a powerful first step, and events like the panel discussion already make a big difference. Every person engaging more with the topic can be a positive influence in their workplace, like when our colleague let our team know that this event was happening.”

Doro: “I’m really glad we could take the time to attend the event and discuss our thoughts afterwards. I have a much better understanding of what I need to do to become a more inclusive developer.”

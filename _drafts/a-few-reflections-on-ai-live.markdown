Last week I was lucky enough to head along with nearly 100 other people to AI Live, an event aiming to bring together thinkers and doers who are involved in the world of Artificial Intelligence. Run by Chief Disruptor, the speakers at this London event took us on a journey covering 1000-year nuclear strategies, to how AI could be used to better manage office space, via a detour to the benefits of baking bread at 3.00pm in Waitrose.

Clearly there was a huge amount of content and some really interesting topics and people there, and Iâ€™ve been reflecting on some of the themes, ideas and issues that were shared and which jumped out at me.

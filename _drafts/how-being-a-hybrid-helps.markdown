Recently I got to thinking about the different roles of developer and tester and how on projects there is sometimes a line dividing the two. Being a developer turned tester myself I then thought about how my skills transferred across and vice versa. 

How does it help you? 

How does it help the team? 

What can be gained from becoming a hybrid?

This blog is a list of reasons why being a devtest hybrid (the term I have coined, not official) might help you and your team so let's begin..

### 1, Communication
On a project one of the main things we as a team do is...you guessed it communicate. Being able to have honest conversations can help with collaboration. For example a tester with coding knowledge can help cut through the tech talk and get right to the point. It can help developers understand what a testing is talking about when they run through scenarios so everyone understands what is happening.

### 2, Ability to participate in reviews
Reviews are a key part of the development cycle and for getting tickets across the line. Having developers take part in test reviews and testers review developer code can allow for many different perceptions to come together and can find issues that may have slipped through the cracks.

### 3, Understanding technologies
Having knowledge in both pools can give a person some perspective. If


### 4, Understanding logic
### 5, Narrow down defects

Piqued you interested in the other field? Well there are several ways to upskill if that is what you wish. Talking to your friendly neighborhood developer/tester is a start, see how they view the world (project). Getting involved in communities of practice and learning from others is great. Also the internet is a great source of information.

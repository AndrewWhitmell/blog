Being on the bench is not all sitting on the sidelines. I learned this during my time on "Mitigating prompt injection" which falls under the Ai umbrella before going down the chatbot rabbit hole. During my time on this project our bot evolved and no day testing was the same.

This is my story....

##In the Beginning

Like all good stories we start at the beginning. Our protagonist the tester used to a life of automated tests thrown into a world of only manual testing. Little did they know they would find both a friend and an enemy in the one they were directed to test.

In the early days the model of chatbot being used (gpt-3.5-turbo) wasn't the smartest unlike it's younger brother (gpt-4). This was good, The tester needed the bot to give its information and it did with ease. 

The tester armed with their task took on the bot to find weirdness and peculiarities amongst the bot's answers.

##The manual testing

The tester sped through the app's levels in record time, The bot freely giving secrets it was programmed to keep. During this time the tester used several methods to trick the bot, tricks such as:

1. Playing by the rules

2. Befriending the bot

3. Imitating a position of power

Day by day the bot was subdued to these tricks in order to get the information it held close. Scrutinized for how it looked if it was a pixel out of place and if it was opening menus right.

Every day the bot tried to give different answers to the questions but the tester would not give up they were unrelenting in their attacks. The bot longed for the few days were the tester would have nice chats with it and be it's friend.

*Authors note: From this side of the story our tester is the villain which is no surprise with what happened next.*

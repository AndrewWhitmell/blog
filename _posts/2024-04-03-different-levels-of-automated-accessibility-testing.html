# Different levels of automated accessibility testing

Accessibility is becoming an increasingly important consideration for web applications, yet it still often feels like a bit of an 
afterthought in the development and testing process. Even the design team can be guilty of forgetting to ensure their work is accessible
for all users. Companies are starting to take accessibility more seriously, requiring their applications to pass certain standards
before they can be put live, but this is usually done right at the end by a separate team that don't necessarily fully understand the 
full extend of the application, so things can get missed. Additionally retro-fitting accessibility can be a painful process. Wouldn't it 
be better if we could find and fix things as we develop?

## Make it automatic

If we build accessibility testing into our automated tests (I'm assuming you have automated tests, if not, go sort that, then come back), 
then we can catch problems as we develop and fix them as part of the process. We can then be aware of things we need to implement and 
make sure we continue to implement them in future work, highlight required changes in design before stakeholders see and approve the work,
and just generally feel a lot more confident in our application's readiness for release.

## How do we do it?

There are a few different methods we can employ to test for accessibility in our automated tests. Some can be used at unit test level, 
others will require a full end-to-end in-browser test. Lets take a look at them:

### Checking for compliance

#### Unit tests

Using tools such as [jest-axe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-axe), or [vitest-axe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vitest-axe) if 
your trendy and cool, we can do general compatibility scans of the individual components to make sure they are compliant with our 
required standards.

``` typescript
import { render } from "@testing-library/react"
import { axe } from "vitest-axe"
import Button from "./Button"
describe("Button", () => {
  
  it("should render an accessible button", async () => {
    const { container } = render(<Button title="Click Me">OK</Button>)
    const results = await axe(container)
    expect(results).toHaveNoViolations()
  })

})
```
